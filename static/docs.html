Webhook Documentation

There are many types of webhooks in Fates List, however you MUST select Vote Webhook for votes unless you are using Fates Client or another library

Your webhook will be sent in this format:
	id: String -> User ID
	votes: Integer -> Votes
	
The webhook will have a Authorization header with your API Token.
The Test API Token (so you can try out the webhook) is eb83da1b-1bbf-44e6-a938-5545bcc2934f. This only applies to webhooks and not for other non webhook related things

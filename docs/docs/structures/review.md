# Reviews

All reviews share the below format. This structure is used in the Get Review API and in new review and edit review events.

Reviews totally have two parts. The list of review objects \(and their replies\) in the reviews key and a key called average\_stars at the end of all reviews and replies which tells you the average stars your bot \(or server\) has overall as a float

## Switcher Tabs

| Internal Name/ID | Display Name | Description  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| long-description | Description | The long description tab. Also the default tab |
| reviews | Reviews | The review tab |
| commands | Commands | The commands tab (coming soon) |
| about | About | The about tab |
| admin | Admin | The admin tab. Not user accessible and we have a staff panel so trying to hide this will result in a bot ban as soon as we find out |

Suffix a tab with `tab` to get the id (example: `#reviews-tab`)
